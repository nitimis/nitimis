# nitimis

The primary goal of Nitimis is to build a template for a self sustainable, sociopolitical and economic system that is fair and equal towards all it's citizens. We provide opportunities to young parents to raise their kids without them having to worry about food, housing, education & healthcare.

Our primary focus is to collaborate with said parents and understand how their skills can be used in tech. if not tech, at least within our community. Our mission is to raise as many kids as possible in this manner and prove that the system is scalable & self sustainable. We plan to build a bunch of open source products. The revenue from hosted version of these products will be put back into supporting this community. Members of our organization also help progressive political candidates around the world (in whatever nano way we can). We run the Progressive India meetup group and the PyLGBTQIA+ meetup group.
